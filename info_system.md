# Super information system(SIS)/Super Structure
- An Information system is an ecosystem of components(people, data, technologies) capable of following functions in specific context.
  - Collect data
  - Store data
  - Process data
  - Distribute data
  - Generate data/new information.
- We(humans) are capable of performing all above functions.
- In our case, context is whole human civilization and wherever humans can navigate or interact/perform actions (SIS).
- From human information reception POV, SIS dominantly includes: Education system, TV news/newspaper, digital social media, books, movies and other entertainment media, websites and other humans.
- Formation of most of belief system is influences by SIS including cultural beliefs, identity values(Two traits). Human society and SIS continuously interact with each other and co-evolve(<new-tab-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_ecology">Media ecology</new-tab-link>).
- Throughout the evolution the SIS was only limited to:
  - Information needed to survive and thrive in the physical world/terrain like info about resources and dangers.
  - Other people in society, social network, social structure.
- Within few decades, the SIS has grown orders of magnitude higher in complexity and in quantity of information after introduction of mass media. We are not evolutionarily equipped to consciously and statistically discern each and every piece of information we receive and form cognitive model/mental schema which are free of cognitive inconsistency/semantic dissonance.
- Implementation of [identity wiring](weaponisation.md#identity-wiring), execution of [identity fishing](weaponisation.md#identity-fishing) is conducted through information system.
- The diagram below attempts high level visualization.
  - Blue nodes: individuals/agent. Blue node network: Society(high level)
  - Red/pink: Recently formed component but most dominant information source. Red lines shows each node interacts with mass media in personal capacity OR mass media is capable of engaging with whole society on individual level bypassing local social constraints.

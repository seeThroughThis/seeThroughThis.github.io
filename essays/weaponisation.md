# Weaponisation of human psychology.
Listing terms and possible methods in brief for documentation purposes. In the context of economic, cognitive/psy warfare, many of the methods/phenomena are not inherently negative and can occur naturally, but the high complexity of the matter makes it practically impossible for large populations to be free of its influence, whether induced or natural, emphasising <todo/> long-standing necessity of watchdogs functionally independent of existing (potentially biased) power structures.

## Warfare:
Reasons behind initiating warfare include capturing resources, reaffirming dominance, neutralising perceived threats, increasing identity influence.

## Types of warfare
Modes of warfare co-occur depending on belligerent capabilities and the degree of escalation. Almost every time, the initial phases include economic, information, cognitive/psy, and identity warfare.

### Physical warfare
In this mode, belligerents are actively trying to inflict physical damage to habitat/infrastructure and humans.

### Economic warfare
Tactics include imposing taxes, blockades, boycotting targeted identity, and the use of existing economic high ground to control market access. Can be used in combination with cognitive, identity warfare in potent combination.

### Cognitive warfare
Methods include propagating information that exploits cognitive biases, emotionally influencing target identity/sub-identity through mass media like news, entertainment media. Inducing predisposition against PsyOps.

Combined with economics, economic stimulus can be provided to sub-identity(ies) within a particular region, inducing identity divide/breakaway, influencing political policy, dictating long-term economic growth, ability at expense to cause civil unrest through stimulus disturbance to increase economic stress.

{: #social-truth }
- **Social truth, Social referencing**: Number of nodes that validate or refer to a particular statement, regardless of whether that statement is factually true, false or partial. A higher degree of such social reference weight causes informational social influence towards other informationally close proximity nodes, leading to self-sustained growth, persistence of the information and becoming a **social truth**. Even if an individual is aware that a social truth is factually false doesn’t necessarily mean the individual can act/behave independent of that social truth. Not all nodes have the same weightage. Few high rank nodes tend to override/enforce information against a large number of low weight nodes(large populations), hence social truth is subject to manipulation through high rank nodes such as internet sites/docs representing reputed organisations, search engines, AI, and biased high rank personalities. Nodes: Nodes can be an individual human, organisation, non-human entities such as search engines, AI, websites etc (so far, non-human entities are still controlled by humans). Information perception is also subject to constraints of biases, including identity labelling, social rank (status) of the distributor node from the POV of the receiver human node.

{: #belief-break }
- **belief break**: Any observed/perceived information or experiences, especially in a non-negligible quantity and in a relevant time span, that is contradictory/not aligned to existing beliefs within the context can render that belief model false. In other words, there is a non-negligible error/discrepancy between the mind’s current belief (conscious reality) and actual reality WRT perceived information. The perceived information is subject to manipulation to cause belief break.

- We [discussed here](/essays/identity) that identity (two traits) is a critical basis for social collaboration, group behaviour, and biological competition; hence, regardless of the phase of the warfare/intensity of biological competition, identity is the core component at play.

{: #identity-wiring }
- **Identity wiring**: Identity wiring refers to the design of the sentiments and opinions of various identities towards each other and the self, driven by stereotyping, association bias. These beliefs are formed by social truths, e.g. information propagated through social talks, mass media, and historical records. This heavily influences further/ongoing warfare of any mode.
  
{: #identity-fishing }
- **Identity fishing**: Propagating intricately designed information through various media targeted towards specific identity(ies). Perception effects include reinforcing/altering identity wiring, distorting perceived identity norm.

- PsyOps (Psychological operations): Unlike psy warfare tactics, which are always deployed through the info system/media, Operations are devised according to the latest system state developments and to achieve a specific objective to sustain a broader design plan.

- Specialised PsyOps: Psychological/cognitive warfare and standard Ops patterns can be identified through analysis of vast data consisting detailed historical data and current affairs. Specialised PsyOps are conducted within extremely controlled environment and social hierarchies.
  - **Potential objectives** include streamlining, forming hierarchies with required identity composition. Establishing controlled economic networks. Manufacturing controlled leadership/high rank person to influence large populations by abusing hierarchy bias. War games. All objectives are mutually inclusive. Designed to achieve goals without leaking information to public media, and large populations.
  - Activity roles: Attempting explanation of roles using lever mechanism analogy(targets include civilians).
    - Pivot:
      - This includes an individual primary target and the target’s close social nodes, e.g. family members.
      - Subject to: Extreme mental stress, induced identity crisis, mental disorders and loneliness. Physical health deterioration. Recurrent suicidal thoughts.
    - Orchestrators(deep hierarchies):
      - Orchs are like an acting force on the lever and the ones who devise plans and initiate execution.
      - Relatively high awareness about actual truths, cognitive/psywar tactics, under less influence of biases and social truths, hence in a position to abuse and exploit unaware people.
      - Responsible for manufacturing moral high ground, social truths to initiate psyop.
      - Responsible for selecting pivot based on geolocational identity design and pivot's low social connections in close proximity <new-tab-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network">social network</new-tab-link>, enabling social isolation.
      - Weaponisation of psychology is not widely acknowledged, enabling such social entities to engage in covert ops without checks and balances.
    - Lever:
      - Consists of a large number of people assembled in multiple social hierarchies in multiple geolocations and points in time.
      - Assembled to manipulate the environment of the pivot to influence behaviour and gather information.
      - Most people are under the heavy influence of biases such as <new-tab-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink">groupthink</new-tab-link>, cognitive/psy war tactics, hence vulnerable to coercion by orchestrators.
      - Self-sustained behaviour after initial phase, easy to assemble new hierarchies using using social truth and connections.
    - Standard PsyOp execution steps include:
      - Performing several methods cyclically over a span of decades and multiple generations of pivot, such as: 
        - Manufacturing moral high ground, which is provided to people assembling hierarchies (lever).
        - Using hierarchies to manipulate the environment of the target to disturb and induce abnormal behaviour. Information achieves state of [social truth](#social-truth) in the locality.
        - Using disturbed behaviour as moral high ground, creating opportunities to repeat the cycle and achieving self-sustained lever behaviour.
      - Using assembled hierarchies with <new-tab-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_agency">"Structure and Agency"</new-tab-link> and <new-tab-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_blanket">Markov blanket</new-tab-link> to carry out various cognitive attacks including:
        - [belief break](#belief-break), false-positive and false-negative feedback to the reward system, inflicting mental injuries/traumatising by harassment, taunting, etc. 
        - Force ingestion of information(projecting social truth) through social conversations, social media engagement, etc., reinforcing biases, disinformation, controlling thoughts.
        - Exploiting free will by controlling action space, limiting choices. Induced helplessness.
        - Pivot's high sensitivity towards informational social influence, normative social influence, and naturally selected high reward functions are exploited. Inducing addictions. 
        - Controlling cash flow/economic stress. Op execution, information gathering via digital and non-digital means.
        - Recreating similar experiences for close social nodes, inducing emotional normal and deterring aid engagement.
        - Disrupting and deteriorating the social network of the pivot. Antagonising close social nodes (e.g. family members, friends).
        - Abusing widespread disinformation about human behaviour, mental disorders and equipping labelling, stereotyping against pivot.

  {: #relations-reset }
  - Relations reset: This is an individual-level cognitive attack, which we'll try to understand using a diagram below, where we'll attempt visualising personal social network.
    - The centre node is the target node. Surrounding nodes connected to the centre node denote individuals in the direct social network
    - Concentric circles try to quantise the relationship closeness, e.g. 1-10, 11-30, etc. (These numbers and the abstractions mentioned are hardcoded high-level examples to quantise information and are not meant to be compulsion. Also, relationship weights are from the POV of the central node/individual and not two-way)
    - Circles are further divided into groups A, B, and C (differently coloured pies). This denotes further compartmentalisation within a specific range. e.g range 1-10 consists of multiple social groups, including family and friends etc. And conversations we engage with a specific friend group do not mean we'll exchange the same info with other social groups, nor do we expect these isolated groups to exchange personal information without consent.
    - This attack exactly disrupts the above natural expectation by repeatedly sharing information between compartments and propagating back to the target node. Leads to the collapse of the relationship schema/model, inflicting mental injury, causing anxiety, paranoia, and inability to seek direct help. Social nodes deny acknowledgement on attempt of conversation.
    - All the nodes in the social network in the diagram, which are positioned within a specific range/weights when in a healthy state, will reset back to, let's say, 90-100 after a successful attack.
    - This vulnerability allows orchs force rebuild the social network with preferred social nodes to gain control of the target node/individual.
    - Increased vulnerability and effects when the target is in an active, unresolved identity crisis, since the overall cognitive model is already destabilized including the relationship schema.

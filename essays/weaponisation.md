# Weaponisation of human psychology.
Listing terms and possible methods in brief for documentation purposes. In the context of economic, cognitive/psy warfare, many of the methods/phenomena are not inherently negative and can occur naturally but high complexity of the matter makes it practically impossible for large populations to be free of its influence whether induced or natural, emphasising <todo/> long-standing necessity of watchdogs functionally independent of existing biased power structures.

### Warfare:
Reasons behind initiating warfare include capturing resources, reaffirming dominance, neutralising potential threats and increasing identity influence. Almost every time the initial phases include economic, information, cognitive/psy, identity warfare hence it’s not true every time that the party which triggers the physical phase is the initiator of war in a holistic sense.

### Types of warfare
- Physical warfare- In this phase belligerents are actively trying to inflict physical damage to habitat/infrastructure and humans.

- Economic warfare- Tactics include imposing taxes, blockades, boycotting targeted identity, use of existing economic high ground to control market access.

- Cognitive warfare: Widely acknowledged methods include propagating information that exploit cognitive biases, emotionally influencing target identity/sub-identity through various mediums like news, mass media.
  - Combined with economics, economic stimulus can be provided to sub-identity(ies) within a particular region, inducing identity breakaway/loosening, influencing political policy, dictating long-term economic growth, ability at expense to cause civil unrest through stimulus disturbance by increasing economic stress.
  
  {: #social-truth }
  - **Social truth, Social referencing**: Number of sources/nodes that validates or refers to a particular statement regardless of whether that statement is factually true, false or partial. A higher degree of social reference weight causes <new-tab-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof">informational social influence</new-tab-link> towards other socially, informationally close proximity nodes, leading to self-sustained growth, persistence of the information and becoming a **social truth**. Even if an individual is aware of a social truth being factually false doesn’t necessarily mean the individual can act/behave independent of that social truth. Not all nodes have same weightage. Few high rank nodes tend to override/enforce information against large number of low weight nodes(large populations) hence social truth is subject to manipulation through high rank nodes such as internet sites/docs representing reputed organisations, search engines, AI, biased high rank personalities. Nodes: Nodes can be an individual human, organisation, non-human entities such as search engines, AI, websites etc(so far non-human entities are still controlled by humans). Information perception/reception is also subject to constraint of biases including identity labelling of distributer node from POV of receiver human node.

  - We [discussed here](/essays/identity) that identity (two traits) is critical basis for social collaboration, group behaviour, and biological competition hence regardless of the phase of warfare/intensity of biological competition, identity is the core component at play.

  {: #identity-wiring }
  - **Identity wiring**: Identity wiring refers to the design of the sentiment and opinions of various identities towards each other and self, driven by stereotyping bias. These beliefs are formed by social truths e.g. information propagated through social talks, mass media, historical records. This heavily influences further/ongoing warfare of any mode.
  
  {: #identity-fishing }
  - **Identity fishing**: Propagating intricately designed information through various media targeted towards specific identity(ies). Perception effects include reinforcing/altering identity wiring, distorting perceived social identity design.
  

  - PsyOps: Unlike psy warfare tactics which are always deployed through the info system/media, ops are devised according to latest system state developments or to achieve specific objective to sustain broader design plan.
    - **Potential objectives** include streamlining, forming hierarchies with required identity composition. Establishing controlled economic networks. Manufacturing controlled leadership/high rank person to influence large populations abusing hierarchy bias. War games. All objectives are mutually inclusive.
    - Activity roles: Attempting explanation of roles using lever mechanism analogy(performed on non-military/civilian personnel).
      - Pivot:
        - This includes an individual primary target and the target’s close social nodes e.g. family members.
        - Subject to: Extreme mental stress, induced mental disorders and loneliness. Physical health damage.
      - Orchestrators(deep hierarchies):
        - Orchs are like acting force on the lever and the ones who devise plans and initiate execution.
        - Relatively high awareness about actual truths, cognitive/psywar tactics, under less influence of biases and social truths hence in a position to abuse and exploit unaware people.
        - Responsible for manufacturing moral high ground, social truths to initiate psyop.
        - Responsible for selecting pivot based on geolocational identity design and pivot's low social connections in close proximity <new-tab-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network">social network</new-tab-link>, abling social isolation.
        - Weaponisation of psychology is not widely acknowledged enabling such social entities to engage in covert ops without checks and balances.
      - Lever:
        - Consists of large number of population assembled in multiple social hierarchies in multiple geolocations and points in time.
        - Assembled to manipulate the environment of pivot to influence behaviour and gather information.
        - Most of people under the heavy influence of biases such as <new-tab-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink">groupthink</new-tab-link>, cognitive/psy war tactics hence vunlerable to coercion by orchestrators.
      - Standard psyop execution steps include:
        - Performing several methods cyclically over a span of decades and multiple generations of pivot such as manufacturing moral high ground which is provided to people assembling hierarchies (lever), manipulating the environment of the target to disturb and induce abnormal behaviour creating opportunities to repeat the cycle and achieving self-sustained lever behaviour and [social truth](#social-truth).
        - Using assembled hierarchies, and <new-tab-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_agency">structure and agency</new-tab-link> to carry out various cognitive attacks including:
          - belief break, false-positive and false-negative feedback to reward system, inflicting mental injuries/traumatising by harassment, taunting etc. 
          - Controlling ingestion of information(projecting social truth) through social conversations, social media engagement etc. reinforcing biases, disinformation.
          - Exploiting free will by controlling action space, limiting choices. Induced helplessness.
          - Pivot's high sensitivity towards informational social influence, normative social influence, naturally selected high reward functions are exploited. Inducing addictions. 
          - Controlling cash flow/economic stress. Op execution, information gathering via digital and non-digital means.
          - Recreating similar experiences for close social nodes, inducing emotional normal and deterring aid engagement.
          - Abusing widespread disinformation about human behaviour, mental disorders and equipping labelling, stereotyping against pivot.
  - Relations reset: This is an individual level cognitive attack which we'll try to understand using diagram below where we'll attempt visualising personal social network.
    - Center node is target node. Surrounding nodes connected to center node denote individuals in direct social network
    - Concentric circles try to quantize the relationship closeness e.g. 1-10, 11-30 etc. (These numbers and below mentioned abstractions are hardcoded high-level examples to quantize information and are not meant to be compulsion. Also, relationship weights are from POV of central node/individual and not two-way)
    - Circles are further divided in groups A, B, C (differently coloured pies). This denotes further compartmentlisation within specific range. e.g range 1-10 consists of multiple social groups including family and friends and conversations we engage with a specific friends group does not mean we'll exchange same info with other social groups nor we expect these isolated groups to exchange personal information without consent.
    - This attack exactly disrupts the above natural expectation by repeatedly sharing information in-between compartments and propagating back to target node leading to collapse of relationship schema/model causing anxiety, paranoia, inability to seeking direct help.
    - All the nodes in social network in the diagram which are psotioned within specific range/weights when healthy state will reset back to let's say 90-100 after successful attack.
    - This vulnerability allows orchs force rebuild social network with preferrable social nodes to gain control of the target node/individual.
    - Increased vulnerability and effects when target is in active, unresolved identity crisis since overall cognitive model is already destabilized.

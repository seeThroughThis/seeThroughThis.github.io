## Perception
- Since birth, cognitive model develops continuously from information is gathered from environment in recurrent process. 
- Information perception involves below co-occurring functions:
  - Emotions:
    - Realtime emotional response to incoming data/experiences.
  - Cognitive biases: <new-tab-link href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg">(Cognitive bias codex)</new-tab-link>
    - Identity biases:
      - Prioritising self group affiliation over other identities.
      - Tendency to accept and propagate information within identity.
      - Groupthink, herd behaviour, hierarchy, stereotyping bias.
    - Sampling biases/data biases:
      - Perception of specific event, information is supported by the existing contextual information which may not be accurate sampling of actual reality leading to skewed perception.
      - Even if existing information is a good sample, the sample actually to used for perception, decision-making maybe be skewed due to incoming information.
      - Information/perception about self is primarily driven by environmental/social feedback which can be skewed leading to distorted self-perception as does the prolonged thinking about either "positive" or "negative" points.
      - If information is emotionally stimulating, it will influence decision-making/conclusion and memory retrieval WRT emotional valence. Various emotional experiences acts as data to allow empathising with respective context.
  - [Reward system](/essays/reward_system)
  - Learned information
    - Information learned in a specific iteration can be used to analyze incoming information in subsequent iterations.
    - Capable of learning and increase awareness about evolutionary drives– emotions, reward system, biases– and possibly reduce their influence while critical thinking.
    - Refer to subdiagram below.

## Contemplating over existing data
- As seen in *C1*, contemplating over existing memories, data will lead to same response from evolutionary components *C2*. In this is case, critical thinking can be more effective due to absence of environmental constraints.

## Perception
- Since birth, cognitive model develops continuously from information is gathered from environment in recurrent process. 
- Information perception involves below co-occurring functions:
  - Emotions:
    - Realtime emotional response to incoming data/experiences.
  - Cognitive biases: They occur within their effective context.
    - Identity biases:
      - Prioritising self group affiliation over other identities.
      - Tendency to accept and propagate information within identity.
      - Groupthink, herd behaviour.
    - Subjective normal biases (Baseline):
      - Perception of specific event, information is supported by the existing contextual information. The existing information may not be accurate sampling of actual reality (within context) leading to skewed perception.
    - Association biases:
      - Information association, labelling
  - [Reward system](/essays/reward_system)
  - Learned information
    - Information learned in a specific iteration can be used to analyze incoming information in subsequent iterations.
    - Capable of learning and increase awareness about evolutionary drives– emotions, reward system, biases– and possibly reduce their influence while critical thinking.
    - Refer to subdiagram below.

## Contemplating over existing data
- As seen in *C1*, contemplating over existing memories, data will lead to same response from evolutionary components *C2*. In this is case, critical thinking can be more effective due to absence of environmental constraints.

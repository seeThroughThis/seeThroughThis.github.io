## Perception
- Since birth, cognitive model develops continuously from information is gathered from environment in recurrent process. 
- Information perception involves below co-occurring functions:
### Emotions:
- Realtime emotional response to incoming data/experiences.
### Cognitive biases: 
- Full <new-tab-link href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg">cognitive bias codex here</new-tab-link>. Below is attempt to collate most of them into few classes.
- **Sampling biases/data biases**:
  - Perception of specific event, information is supported by the existing contextual information which may not be accurate sampling of actual reality leading to skewed perception.
  - Information/perception about self is primarily driven by environmental/social feedback which can be skewed leading to distorted self-perception as does the prolonged thinking about either "positive" or "negative" points.
  - Various personal experiences including emotional, acts as data to allow empathising with respective context. Absence of contextual experiences may create empathy gap.
- **Association biases**:
  - Association between information/data is mainly driven by semantic meaning but prone to malformation if reinforced by environment.
  - Even if existing information is a good sample, the sample actually to used for perception, decision-making maybe be skewed due to incoming information.
  - Within context, recently learned or frequently accessed/reinforced information is likely to influence thought process regardless of relevance.
  - If information is emotionally stimulating, its association tend to influence decision-making/conclusion and memory retrieval WRT emotion and its valence.
- **Identity biases**:
  - Prioritising self group affiliation over other identities. Tendency to accept and propagate information within identity.
  - Groupthink, herd behaviour, hierarchy bias.
  - Identity biases coupled with sampling bias influences perceived norm of various [identity variables](/essays/identity#id-variables), cultural beliefs and practices.
  - Coupled with association bias leads to identity stereotyping.

### [Reward system](/essays/reward_system)
### Learned information
- Information learned in a specific iteration can be used to analyze incoming information in subsequent iterations. Refer to subdiagram below.
- Capable of learning and increase awareness about evolutionary drives– emotions, reward system, biases– and possibly reduce their influence while critical thinking.

## Contemplating over existing data
- As seen in *C1*, contemplating over existing memories and data will lead to simi response from evolutionary components *C2*. In this is case, critical thinking can be more effective due to absence of environmental constraints.

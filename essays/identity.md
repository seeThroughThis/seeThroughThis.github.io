# Identity
- Single most important evolutionary behavior from social stability POV.
- Identity consists of the:
  - The “**two traits**”:
    1. Group affiliation (<new-tab-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_identity_theory">Social identity theory</new-tab-link>)
    2. Territorial association.
  - Individuality / individual role WRT two traits.
- Evolutionarily, and even in present-time tribal settings the two traits are near-compulsory mutually inclusive.
- Economic, trading activities in-between identities ease up two traits. Reversely, resource scarcity / high economic stress intensifies identity and biological competition.
- In modern times, current implementation of nation-state-culture system induces sense of identity with decoupled “two traits” without safeguards against identity exploitation of large populations.
- Identity is constantly exploited through political/economic/violent means worldwide (inter-national, intra-national).
- Examples of variables across which identity can be leveraged or exploited:
  - Territorial provocations: Challenging territorial/boundaries status quo, territory partitioning/border redrawing to create new disputes.
  - **Non-territorial identity variables**: countries/states, communities, sub-communities, ideologies (left, right, capitalism, communism), physical attributes (various skin, hair colours, mono-lid eyes), religions, ethnicities, languages, gender/sexual orientations and recently trending generations (millennial, gen z etc.)
- On the positive side, Achievements are celebrated in identity crossovers such as sport victories, technological, scientific advancements etc.
- Individual identity / role is powerful and influential from high rank [nodes](/essays/appendices/glossary#social-node) / personalities POV.

## Identity crisis
- Any observed/perceived information or experiences especially in non-negligible quantity and relevant time span that is contradictory/not aligned to existing identity beliefs leads to identity crisis.
- The two traits model collapses. When we say collapse it’s not the two traits itself but the values it holds.
- Unlike sudden mental injury/trauma, identity crisis gradually affects overall behaviour, destabilizing primary cognitive model.
- Since identity is core value for normal human functioning The brain triggers a mechanism in order to rebuild the identity cognitive model.
- Due to the injured mental state, years of existing pieces of information/memories are in dangling state. Information gushing in from the environment is not efficiently and accurately analysed, labelled, assigned importance weights causing cognitive overload.

### Symptoms/Behavioural traits of active identity crisis
Increased sensitivity to overall environmental stimuli. Increased vulnerability to addictions, naturally selected high reward functions/stimuli e.g. Sexual attraction/porn, social stimuli, food cravings. Discomfort in society, low confidence, emotional volatility including impulsivity, mood polarity, mimicking behaviour of others/increased sensitivity to social proof, normative social influence. Unrestrained emotional and reward driven thinking/behaviour. In order to rebuild behavioural model, going through existing memories/data trying to find patterns and possibilities leading to day dreaming, self talk, subject to hallucination. Doorway to disorders.

### About recovery
- Extreme information-dense modern environment is the primary cause of identity crisis as well as the obstacle for recovery. Due to the same, victim is prone to identity foreclosure.
- Most of these problems occur when deprived of aid and true feedback from environment/society.
- A natural way to recover is allowance of engagement in meaningful activities socially, culturally, economically which acts as true-positive feedback/rewards for brain to rebuild neural pathways.
- Because of the higher sensitivity to environmental stimuli, an active identity crisis (identity moratorium) is a highly valued mental state from PsyOps POV. Applications at individual and population scale. The use of this knowledge for psychological, socio-economic warfare is not acknowledged widely nor safeguards exist in society. Unlike traditional physical warfare these attacks are relatively difficult to predict, identify and confirm.

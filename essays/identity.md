# Identity
- Single most important evolutionary behavior from social stability POV.
- Identity consists of the “**two traits**”:
  1. Group affiliation (<new-tab-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_identity_theory">Social identity theory</new-tab-link>)
  2. Territorial association.
- Evolutionarily, and even in present-time tribal settings the two traits are near-compulsory mutually inclusive.
- This is applicable to all social animals (Chimpanzees, Bonobos, Hyenas, Wolves, Lions etc.)
- Economic, trading activities in-between identities easing up two traits. Reversely, resource scarcity / high economic stress leads to intensified identity and biological competition.
- In modern times, current implementation of nation-state-culture system induces sense of identity with decoupled “two traits” without safeguards against identity exploitation of large populations.
- Identity is constantly exploited through political/economic/violent means worldwide (inter-national, intra-national).
- Examples of variables across which identity can be leveraged or exploited:
  - Territorial provocations: Challenging territorial/boundaries status quo, territory partitioning/border redrawing to create new disputes.
  - **Non-territorial identity variables**: countries/states, communities, sub-communities, ideologies (left, right, capitalism, communism), physical attributes (various skin, hair colours, mono-lid eyes), religions, ethnicities, languages, gender/sexual orientations and recently trending generations (millennial, gen z etc.)
- On the positive side, Achievements are celebrated in identity crossovers such as sport victories, technological, scientific advancements etc.

## Identity crisis
- Repetitively observed/perceived information or experiences within relevant time span that is contradictory/not aligned to existing identity beliefs leads to identity crisis.
- The two traits model collapses. When we say collapse it’s not the two traits itself but the values it holds.
- Unlike sudden mental injury/trauma, identity crisis gradually affects overall behaviour, destabilizing primary cognitive behaviour model.
- Since identity is core value for normal human functioning The brain triggers a mechanism in order to rebuild the identity cognitive model.
- Due to the injured mental state, years of existing pieces of information/memories are in dangling state. Information gushing in from the environment is not efficiently and accurately analysed, labelled, assigned importance weights causing cognitive overload.
- Symptoms/Behavioural traits: Increased vulnerability to addictions, naturally selected high reward functions/stimuli e.g. Sexual attraction/porn, social stimuli, food cravings. Discomfort in society, low confidence, emotional volatility including impulsivity, mood polarity, mimicking behaviour of others/increased sensitivity to social proof, normative social influence. unrestrained emotional and reward driven thinking/behaviour, going through existing memories/data trying to find patterns and possibilities leading to day dreaming, self talk. Doorway to disorders.
- Most of these problems occur when deprived of aid and true feedback from environment/society.
- The reason behind facing difficulties rebuilding identity is extreme information-dense modern environment. The recovery is also affected by the identity design and its complexity of local society in which victim inhabit but it’s definitely not limited to it as most of the chaotic/politically dynamic regions are often fuelled by international politics.
- Due to the above reasons the identity is most likely to be malformed by information ingested from the environment.
- A natural way to recover is allowance of engagement in meaningful activities socially, culturally, economically which acts as true-positive feedback/rewards for brain to rebuild neural pathways.
- Because of the higher sensitivity to environmental stimuli, an active identity crisis is a highly valued mental state from PsyOps POV. Applications at individual and population scale.
- The use of this knowledge for psychological, socio-economic warfare is not acknowledged widely nor safeguards exist in society. Unlike traditional physical warfare these attacks are relatively difficult to predict, identify and confirm.

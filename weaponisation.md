# Weaponisation of human psychology.
Listing terms and possible methods in brief for documentation purposes. In the context of economic, cognitive/psy warfare, many of the methods are not inherently negative but their implementation can be.

### Warfare:
Reasons behind initiating warfare include capturing resources, reaffirming dominance, neutralising potential threats and increasing identity influence. Almost every time the initial phases include economic, information/psychological warfare. It’s not true every time that the party which triggers the physical phase is the initiator of war in a holistic sense.

### Types of warfare
Physical warfare- In this phase belligerents are actively trying to inflict physical damage to habitat/infrastructure and humans.
Economic warfare- Tactics include imposing taxes, blockades, boycotting targeted identity, use of existing economic high ground to control market access.

- Cognitive warfare: widely acknowledged methods include propagating information that exploit cognitive biases emotionally influences target identity/sub-identity through various mediums like news, mass media.
  - Combined with economics, economic stimulus can be provided to sub-identity(ies) within a particular region, inducing identity breakaway/loosening, influencing political policy, dictating long-term economic growth, ability at expense to cause civil unrest through stimulus disturbance by increasing economic stress.
  - **Social truth, Information referencing**: Number of sources that validates or refers to a particular statement regardless of whether that statement is factually true, false or partial. A higher degree of reference causes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof" target="_blank">informational social influence</a> leading to self-sustained growth of the information becoming a **social truth**. Even if an individual is aware of a social truth being factually false doesn’t necessarily mean the individual can act/behave independent of that social truth. Social truth is subject to manipulation through the internet, social network, search engines, AI, biased high ranking people.
  - **Identity wiring**: Identity wiring refers to the design of sentiment and opinions of various identities towards each other including self, driven by stereotyping bias. These beliefs are formed by information propagated through social talks, historical records, mass media and social truth/high information referencing. This heavily influences further/ongoing warfare of any mode.
  - **Identity fishing**: Propagating intricately designed information through various media targeted towards specific identity(ies). Perception effects include reinforcing/altering identity wiring, distorting perceived identity population distribution.
  - Psyops: Compared to warfare, operations have specific objectives. Psy warfare tactics are always deployed through the system/info media whereas operations are devised according to latest system state developments.
    - Potential objectives include streamlining, forming hierarchies with required identity composition. Manufacturing controlled leadership/high rank person to influence masses abusing hierarchy bias. War games. All objectives are mutually inclusive.
    - Activity roles: Attempting explanation of roles using lever analogy(Non-military, civilian context).
      - Orchestrators(deep hierarchies): Are like acting force on the lever. people who devise execution plans. Relatively high awareness about actual truth, under less influence of biases. Relatively aware of cognitive/psywar tactics hence in a position to abuse, exploit unaware people. Responsible for manufacturing moral high ground, social truths to initiate psyop.
      - Lever: Multiple social hierarchies assembled to manipulate the environment of target(pivot) to influence behaviour. Under the heavy influence of biases. Under impact/influence of cognitive/psy war tactics hence abused by orchestrators.
      - Pivot: This includes an individual pivot target and the target’s closest social nodes e.g. family members. similar to lever in case awareness of biases but additionally selected as a pivot target because of potentially disturbed identity and cognitive model. Subject to extreme mental stress, induced mental disorders and loneliness. Pivot and most of the lever are not aware of orchestrators(deep hierarchy)
      - Standard psyop execution steps include:
        - Performing several methods cyclically over a span of decades such as manufacturing moral high ground which is provided to people assembling hierarchies (lever), manipulating the environment of the target to disturb the behaviour and inducing abnormal behaviour creating opportunities to repeat the cycle and achieving self-sustained social truth and behaviour.
        - Using assembled hierarchies and, structure and agency to carry out various cognitive attacks including: belief break, false-positive and false-negative feedback to reward system, inflicting mental injuries/traumatising by harassment, taunting etc. Reinforcing biases through ingestion of information, information referencing, projecting social truth. Inducing addictions. Target’s high sensitivity towards informational social influence, normative social influence, naturally selected high reward functions exploited. Controlling cash flow/economic stress. Op execution, information gathering via digital and non-digital means.

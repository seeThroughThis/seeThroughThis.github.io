# Weaponisation of human psychology.
Listing terms and possible methods in brief for documentation purposes. In the context of economic, cognitive/psy warfare, many of the methods/phenomena are not inherently negative and can occur naturally but high complexity of the matter makes it practically impossible for large populations to be free of its influence whether induced or natural emphasising long-standing necessity of watchdogs functionally independent of existing biased power structures.

### Warfare:
Reasons behind initiating warfare include capturing resources, reaffirming dominance, neutralising potential threats and increasing identity influence. Almost every time the initial phases include economic, information/psychological warfare hence it’s not true every time that the party which triggers the physical phase is the initiator of war in a holistic sense.

### Types of warfare
- Physical warfare- In this phase belligerents are actively trying to inflict physical damage to habitat/infrastructure and humans.

- Economic warfare- Tactics include imposing taxes, blockades, boycotting targeted identity, use of existing economic high ground to control market access.

- Cognitive warfare: Widely acknowledged methods include propagating information that exploit cognitive biases, emotionally influencing target identity/sub-identity through various mediums like news, mass media.
  - Combined with economics, economic stimulus can be provided to sub-identity(ies) within a particular region, inducing identity breakaway/loosening, influencing political policy, dictating long-term economic growth, ability at expense to cause civil unrest through stimulus disturbance by increasing economic stress.
  - <a id="social-truth"></a>**Social truth, Information referencing**: Number of sources that validates or refers to a particular statement regardless of whether that statement is factually true, false or partial. A higher degree of reference causes large scale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof" target="_blank">informational social influence</a> leading to self-sustained growth of the information and becoming a **social truth**. Even if an individual is aware of a social truth being factually false doesn’t necessarily mean the individual can act/behave independent of that social truth. Social truth is subject to manipulation through the internet, social network, search engines, AI, biased high rank personalities.
  - **Identity wiring**: Identity wiring refers to the design of sentiment and opinions of various identities towards each other including self, driven by stereotyping bias. These beliefs are formed by social truth e.g. information propagated through social talks, historical records, mass media. This heavily influences further/ongoing warfare of any mode.
  - **Identity fishing**: Propagating intricately designed information through various media targeted towards specific identity(ies). Perception effects include reinforcing/altering identity wiring, distorting perceived social identity design.
  - Psyops: Psy warfare tactics are always deployed through the info system/media whereas operations are devised according to latest system state developments or to achieve specific objective to sustain broader design plan.
    - Potential objectives include streamlining, forming hierarchies with required identity composition. Manufacturing controlled leadership/high rank person to influence masses abusing hierarchy bias. War games. All objectives are mutually inclusive.
    - Activity roles: Attempting explanation of roles using lever mechanism analogy(performed on non-military/civilian personnel).
      - Pivot:
        - This includes an individual primary target and the target’s close social nodes e.g. family members.
        - Subject to extreme mental stress, induced mental disorders and loneliness.
      - Orchestrators(deep hierarchies):
        - Orchs are like acting force on the lever and the ones who devise execution plans.
        - Relatively high awareness about actual truths, cognitive/psywar tactics, under less influence of biases and social truths hence in a position to abuse and exploit unaware people.
        - Responsible for manufacturing moral high ground, social truths to initiate psyop.
        - Responsible for selecting pivot based on geolocational identity design and pivot's low social connections in close proximity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network" target="_blank">social network</a>, abling social isolation.
        - Weaponisation of psychology is not widely acknowledged enabling such social entities to engage in covert ops without checks and balances.
      - Lever:
        - Consists of large number of population assembled in multiple social hierarchies in multiple geolocations and points in time spanning decades.
        - Assembled to manipulate the environment of pivot to influence behaviour and gather information.
        - Most of people under the heavy influence of biases such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink" target="_blank">groupthink</a>. Under impact/influence of cognitive/psy war tactics hence vunlerable to coercion by orchestrators.
      - Standard psyop execution steps include:
        - Performing several methods cyclically over a span of decades such as manufacturing moral high ground which is provided to people assembling hierarchies (lever), manipulating the environment of the target to disturb the behaviour and inducing abnormal behaviour creating opportunities to repeat the cycle and achieving self-sustained lever behaviour and [social truth](#social-truth).
        - Using assembled hierarchies and, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_agency" target="_blank">structure and agency</a> to carry out various cognitive attacks including: belief break, false-positive and false-negative feedback to reward system, inflicting mental injuries/traumatising by harassment, taunting etc. Reinforcing biases through ingestion of information, information referencing, projecting social truth. Inducing addictions. Target’s high sensitivity towards informational social influence, normative social influence, naturally selected high reward functions exploited. Controlling cash flow/economic stress. Op execution, information gathering via digital and non-digital means.

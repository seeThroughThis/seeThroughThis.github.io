## A systems-thinking perspective on individual and collective human behaviour, information systems and social design.
Beta version
{: .label .label-yellow }

# Overview
- This is an effort to put forth content in a way it comprehensively explains the individual and collective human behaviour entwined with environment and social systems across scales.
- It aims to explore:
  - How humans obey and divide. How information and incentives influences social structure.
  - How global system state(with high granularity) evolves over time(socially, culturally, economically, territorially). What potential states may emerge in future.
  - Understand the flaws in the current system and pushing towards global sustainable social framework that is harmonic in case of safety(physical/territorial, economic, mental) while allowing constructive, colourful chaos(science, arts, sports etc) and space for other beings and their ecosystems to thrive.
- This approach integrates existing work across various fields(psychology, information science, systems theory, evolutionary history) and extend these perspectives wherever necessary.
- Recommended to use as a manual to be revisited in a loop while contemplating, observing realtime info and studying historical patterns.
- Since we’ll discuss warfare of various modes, mentioning that no argument is hinting towards extremism or pseudo-secularism. Most of the political situations are complex, be cautious while looking at the same using any of the provided info.
- This is in beta and actively in progress— open to refinement, falsification, and extension.

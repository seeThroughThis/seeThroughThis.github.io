## A systems-thinking perspective on individual and collective human behaviour, information systems and social design.
Beta version
{: .label .label-yellow }

# Overview
- This is an effort to put forth content in a way that comprehensively explains the individual and collective human behaviour entwined with environment and social systems across scales.
- Objectives:
  - Understand how humans obey and divide, how information and incentives influence social structure.
  - Modelize global system state (with high granularity), explaining evolution over time (socially, culturally, economically, territorially). What potential states may emerge in future?
  - Understand the flaws in the current system and push towards a global sustainable social framework that is harmonious in case of safety (physical/territorial, economic, mental) while allowing constructive, colourful chaos (science, arts, sports, etc.) and space for other beings and their ecosystems to thrive.
  - Understand the human mind from a functionality POV.
  - Understand the environment thoroughly and the responsible individual's role.
  - Collating and making accessible all the relevant information/knowledge in one place.
- This approach integrates existing work across various fields(psychology, information science, systems theory, evolutionary history) and extends these perspectives wherever necessary.
- Recommended to use as a manual to be revisited in a loop while contemplating, observing real-time info and studying historical patterns.
- This is in beta and actively in progress— open to refinement, falsification, and extension.

## A systems-thinking perspective on individual and collective human behaviour, information systems and social design.
Beta version
{: .label .label-yellow }

# Overview
- This is an effort to put forth content in a way it comprehensively explains the individual and collective human behaviour entwined with environment and social systems across scales.
- Objectives:
  - Understand how humans obey and divide. How information and incentives influences social structure.
  - Modelize global system state (with high granularity) explaining evolution over time (socially, culturally, economically, territorially). What potential states may emerge in future.
  - Understand the flaws in the current system and pushing towards global sustainable social framework that is harmonic in case of safety (physical/territorial, economic, mental) while allowing constructive, colourful chaos (science, arts, sports etc) and space for other beings and their ecosystems to thrive.
  - Understand human mind from functionality POV.
  - Understand the environment thoroughly and responsible individual role.
  - Collating and making accessible all the relevant information/knowledge at one place.
- This approach integrates existing work across various fields(psychology, information science, systems theory, evolutionary history) and extend these perspectives wherever necessary.
- Recommended to use as a manual to be revisited in a loop while contemplating, observing realtime info and studying historical patterns.
- This is in beta and actively in progress— open to refinement, falsification, and extension.

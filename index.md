## A systems-thinking perspective on individual and collective human behaviour, information systems and social design. Beta version
{: .label .label-yellow }

# What? Why? How?
- This is an effort to put forth content concisely in a way it explains the behaviour of individual human and human social systems, everything in one place. Although content is in progress so information will be added, edited as needed.
- Recommended to use as a manual to be revisited in a loop while contemplating, observing realtime info and studying historical data.
- Be able to understand working, reshaping the mind and exercising a higher degree of free will(within moral, legal bounds) rather than being subdued by exploitative/manipulative components in environment.
- Understand the flaws in the current system and pushing towards global sustainable social framework that is harmonic in case of safety(territorial, economic, physical, mental) while allowing constructive, colourful chaos(science, arts, sports etc) and space for other beings and their ecosystems to thrive.
- Try to understand how human obey and divide. How information and incentives influences social designs.
- Since we’ll be putting hands in warfare, mentioning that no argument is hinting towards extremism or pseudo-secularism. Most of the political situations are complex, be cautious while looking at the same using any of the provided info.
- This is in beta — open to refinement, falsification, and extension.

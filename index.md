# What? Why? How?
- This is an effort to put forth content concisely in a way it explains the behaviour of individual human and human social systems, everything in one place. Although content is in progress so information will be added, edited as needed.
- Recommended to use as a manual to be revisited in a loop while contemplating, observing realtime info and studying historical data.
- Be able to understand working, reshaping the mind and exercising a higher degree of free will(within moral, legal bounds) rather than being subdued by exploitative/manipulative components in environment.
- Understand the flaws in the current system and pushing towards global sustainable social framework that is harmonic in case of safety(territorial, economic, physical, mental) while allowing constructive, colourful chaos(science, arts, sports etc) and space for other beings and their ecosystems to thrive.
- Try to understand how human obey and divide. How information and incentives influences social designs.
- Since we’ll be putting hands in warfare, mentioning that no argument is hinting towards extremism or pseudo-secularism. Most of the political situations are complex, be cautious while looking at the same using any of the provided info.
- This is in beta — open to refinement, falsification, and extension.

## Reward system
- This system promotes us taking actions and learn behaviour that leads to benefits and avoid detrimental situations playing an important role in building behavioural model.
- Evolutionary(primary): These reward functions are naturally selected such as sex, social stimuli, eating food etc.
- Learned(secondary): Includes Making money, social media, video games. These are learned behaviours/skills but evolutionary functions still acts as a basis for them e.g. social media simulates social stimuli, video games include social engagement/competition, probabilistic drops, soft materialism. Learning skills to make money because we can buy necessary things like food, home and more.
- Punishments or negative rewards examples include loss of money (non probabilistic way), cold shoulder, breaking law leads to punishments with respective severity, drop in frequency of getting burned while cooking.
- Feeling good or getting kick comes from dopamine surge from baseline level while negative things lead to dopamine dip from the baseline level making you feel blue.
- Regular engagement to rewarding activities leads to decreasing the kick and increasing normal level(moving average) level. Now, just ceasing to engage with the activity can lead to feeling low considering new norm while feeling rewarded will require to engage in higher frequency or intensity. This is why people face difficulties reducing social media, gaming time etc. underlining the importance of dopamine detox, intentional boredom to reset baseline level maintaining balanced behaviour and avoiding addiction.
- A crucial factor for the behavioural development of children to be able lead mentally, functionally healthy life, as their behavioral model, building balanced self-esteem and confidence comes from accurate environmental feedback. Inaccurate feedbacks malforms cogntive lenses leading to inaccurate information perception which further leads to malformed neural pathways. This cycle quickly bloats bad models in modern info-dense environemnt making it extremely difficult to resolve older malformed pathways especially formed in early age.
- It’s important that positive acknowledgements/complements and negative acknowledgements/penalties are delivered accurately for respective actions(correct data labelling). Depending on severity and combination type of desynchronisation between behaviour and environmental feedback can lead to a fragmented behavioural model including emotional response, over/under confidence, polarised personality.
- This remains important throughout adult life to build advanced behaviour and habits shaped by how social system incentivises the its components. People's behaviour is not just driven by direct feedbacks but also perceived patterns about what behaviour leads to high rewards, especially influenced by high rank personalities in social hierarchies where mass observers often fall victim to heuristic pattern learning(shallow copying) e.g. fashion trends, money spending habits even if economically nonviable.

## Identity
- This has to be included as a separate component due to its effect, applications from global scale down to personal lives. This explains the evolution of the demographic-territorial state of the world, how it came to be from historical states and possible states where we head in the future.
- One of the core and most powerful component/bias resulted from natural selection. Also critical from the warfare standpoint
Under its influence humans are capable of assembling together in large populations towards single purpose(constructive, destructive), and compete for resources with other human groups.
- Identity consists of “**The two traits**”:
  1. Who my people are/which human group I belong to? (Ideally a two-way relationship between a person and community)
  2. What my territory is (Not as a private property but social and with shared responsibility among inhabitants)
- Throughout the evolution, or even in present-time tribal settings the territory is shared with “my people” i.e. The two traits are near-compulsory mutually inclusive.
- In fact this is applicable to all social animals(Chimpanzees, Bonobos, Hyenas, Wolves, Lions etc.). In the case of solitary animals everything remains the same except the social collaboration part.
- As humans started producing a variety of goods and trading, its rewards promoted them to step out of their local identity and form economic integration with other identities easing up the two traits. Obviously, easing up the two traits also leads to putting the guard down against invasive identities in both territorial and socio-economic space.
- Reversely, if resources are scarce (high economic stress) identity intensifies and makes us engage in biological competition aggressively.
- In modern times, we have established (seemingly) nation-state system and induce sense of identity in a way that “the two traits” are NOT compulsorily mutually inclusive which can be a positive thing but the presence of lots of other identity variables causes identity confusion in masses and leaving them highly vulnerable against identity crisis/exploit.
- Identity is constantly exploited through political/economic/violent means worldwide(inter-national, intra-national). And it effectively triggers collective emotional reactions among involved people.
- Examples of territorial provocations: Challenging territorial/boundaries status quo, territory partitioning/border redrawing to create new disputes.
- Examples of non-territorial identity variables used to leverage or exploit: countries/states, communities, sub-communities, ideologies(left, right, capitalism, communism), physical attributes(various skin, hair colours, mono-lid eyes), religions, ethnicities, languages, gender/sexual orientations and recently trending generations (millennial, gen z etc.)
- On the positive side, Achievements are celebrated in identity crossovers such as sport victories, technological, scientific advancements etc. but this does allow us to ignore addressing negative ones.
- The collapse of the two traits’ beliefs leads to the identity crisis. Any observed/perceived information or experiences especially in non-negligible quantity and relevant time span that is contradictory/not aligned to existing identity beliefs can render identity model false e.g. Facing repetitive discrimination from people that you consider yours. In other words, there is non-negligible error/discrepancy between mind’s current belief(conscious reality) and actual reality WRT perceived information causing **belief break**(This should be true for all beliefs).
- When we say the model collapses it’s not the two traits itself but the values it holds.
- From my personal experience, the identity crisis is more like slow poisoning rather than sudden trauma. I have seen people suffering from an unresolved identity crisis throughout their whole life without being aware of its existence severely affecting quality of life.
- Errors in our predictions are not that rare but since identity is core value from natural selection POV, the brain triggers a mechanism in order to rebuild the identity cognitive model at the earliest so the victim can successfully survive and navigate in the environment (navigation emphasising on psychological/information action space).
- In CS terminology, the lower confidence score of model predictions leads to ramping up the learning rate (overthinking). Due to the injured mental state the existing pieces of information/memories are in dangling state and information gushing in from the environment is not efficiently/accurately analysed, labelled, assigned importance weights causing cognitive overload. Since our mind supports federated model architecture we can slowly build understanding about psychology to rebuild the primary behavioral cognitive model. It’s like using a malfunctioning tool to fix itself.
- Symptoms/Behavioural traits: Increased vulnerability to addictions, naturally selected high reward functions/stimuli e.g. Sexual attraction/porn, social stimuli. Discomfort in society, emotional volatility including impulsivity, mood polarity, mimicking behaviour of others, increased sensitivity to social proof, normative influence. unrestrained emotional driven thinking, going through existing memories/data trying to find patterns and possibilities leading to day dreaming, self talk. Doorway to disorders. Most of these problems occur when deprived of aid and true feedback from environment/society.
- Most of the behavioural and physical traits of living beings should be explainable by theory of natural selection e.g. cats hiss and fluff up fur when felt threatened, most animals walk/run but kangaroos jump, advertisement of being poisonous by warning colouration(aposematism). All these and infinitely more because that’s what helped them survive, reproduce and thrive iteratively over millions of years (We can say every being’s evolutionary cognitive model is trained over iterations of reproduction, lives trying to maximize their rewards with respect to the environment they evolved in while also considering factor of random mutation)
— I haven’t been able to find a reason why natural selection would debuff us with so many disorders while buffing us with such cognitive prowess. Considering this, rather than fixating on widespread terms like family history, genetics etc. we should cure the social disorder that nurtures malformed environment inducing disorders in individuals. Natural selection does not create statistically significant and major trait deviations in handful of ticks.
- The reason behind facing difficulties rebuilding identity is extreme information-dense modern environment. The recovery is also affected by the identity design and complexity of local society in which victims inhabit but it’s definitely not limited to it as most of the chaotic/politically dynamic regions are often fuelled by international politics.
- Due to the above reasons the identity is most likely to be malformed by information ingested from the environment.
- A natural way to recover is allowance of engagement in meaningful activities socially, culturally, economically which acts as true-positive feedback/rewards for brain to rebuild neural pathways.
- Because of the higher sensitivity to environmental stimuli, an active identity crisis is a highly valued mental state from psyops POV. applications at individual and population scale.
- The use of this knowledge for psychological, socio-economic warfare is not acknowledged widely nor safeguards exist in society. Unlike traditional physical warfare these attacks are relatively difficult to predict, identify and confirm.

# Weaponisation of human psychology.
Listing terms and possible methods in brief for documentation purposes. In the context of economic, cognitive/psy warfare, many of the methods are not inherently negative but their implementation can be.

### Warfare:
Reasons behind initiating warfare include capturing resources, reaffirming dominance, neutralising potential threats and increasing identity influence. Almost every time the initial phases include economic, information/psychological warfare. It’s not true every time that the party which triggers the physical phase is the initiator of war in a holistic sense.

### Types of warfare
Physical warfare- In this phase belligerents are actively trying to inflict physical damage to habitat/infrastructure and humans.
Economic warfare- Tactics include imposing taxes, blockades, boycotting targeted identity, use of existing economic high ground to control market access.

- Cognitive warfare: widely acknowledged methods include propagating information that exploit cognitive biases emotionally influences target identity/sub-identity through various mediums like news, mass media.
  - Combined with economics, economic stimulus can be provided to sub-identity(ies) within a particular region, inducing identity breakaway/loosening, influencing political policy, dictating long-term economic growth, ability at expense to cause civil unrest through stimulus disturbance especially when under high economic stress.
  - **Social truth, Information referencing**: Number of sources that validates or refers to a particular statement regardless of whether that statement is factually true, false or partial. A higher degree of reference causes informative social influence leading to self-sustained growth of the information(social truth). Even if an individual is aware of a social truth being factually false doesn’t necessarily mean the individual can act/behave independent of that social truth. Social truth is subject to manipulation through the internet, social network, search engines, AI, biased high ranking people.
  - **Identity wiring**: Identity wiring refers to the design of sentiment and opinions of various identities towards each other and self driven by stereotyping bias. These beliefs are formed by information propagated through social talks, historical records, mass media and social truth/high information referencing. This heavily influences further/ongoing psychological and information warfare.
  - **Identity fishing**: Propagating intricately designed information through various media targeted towards specific identity(ies). Perception effects include reinforcing/altering identity wiring, distorting perceived identity population distribution.
Psyops: compared to warfare operations have specific objectives. Psy warfare tactics are always deployed through the system/info media whereas operations are devised according to latest system state developments.
  - Potential objectives include streamlining, forming hierarchies with required identity composition. Manufacturing controlled leadership/high rank person to influence masses abusing hierarchy bias. War games. All objectives are mutually inclusive.
  - Activity roles: Attempting explanation of roles using lever analogy(Non-military, civilian context).
    - Orchestrators(deep hierarchies): Are like acting force on the lever. people who devise execution plans. Relatively high awareness about actual truth, under less influence of biases. Relatively aware of cognitive/psywar tactics hence in a position to abuse, exploit unaware people. Responsible for manufacturing moral high ground, social truths to initiate psyop.
    - Lever: Multiple social hierarchies assembled to manipulate the environment of target(pivot) to influence behaviour. Under the heavy influence of biases. Under impact/influence of cognitive/psy war tactics hence abused by orchestrators.
    - Pivot: This includes an individual pivot target and the target’s closest social nodes e.g. family members. similar to lever in case awareness of biases but additionally selected as a pivot target because of potentially disturbed identity and cognitive model. Subject to extreme mental stress, induced mental disorders and loneliness. Pivot and most of the lever are not aware of orchestrators(deep hierarchy)
    - Standard psyop execution steps include:
      - Performing several methods cyclically over a span of decades such as manufacturing moral high ground which is provided to people assembling hierarchies (lever), manipulating the environment of the target to disturb the behaviour and inducing abnormal behaviour creating opportunities to repeat the cycle and achieving self-sustained social truth and behaviour.
      - Using assembled hierarchies and, structure and agency to carry out various cognitive attacks including: belief break, false-positive and false-negative feedback to reward system, inflicting mental injuries/traumatising by harassment, taunting etc. Reinforcing biases through ingestion of information, information referencing, projecting social truth. Inducing addictions. Target’s high sensitivity towards informative social influence, normative influence, naturally selected high reward functions exploited. Controlling cash flow/economic stress. Op execution, information gathering via digital and non-digital means.
